# Wish Herb Coordinates
These files contain vector3 coordinates specific to different areas, including a separate file for bulrush and burdock locations (since these herbs like being near water). 
In total, nearly 8,000 coordinates that I've gathered over the years.

Use these coords in your respective herb script or any other script that needs coords scattered around the map.
All Z-axis are set to the floor. I am working on an orchid coord file, which I will add once completed.

Enjoy!
